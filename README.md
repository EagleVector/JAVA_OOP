# JAVA_OOP

### Differences between Abstraction and Encapsulation.

## Abstraction
1. Design level oriented.
2. Hides the unnecessary complexities and only shows the things that are important.
3. Final functions of classes which renders the result by direct application are example of abstraction.
4. To start a car we only need the key. We are definitely not interested in the internal mechanisms of the car.

## Encapsulation
1. Implementation level oriented.
2. Wrapping up all the classes, methods, properties into one. --> "Encapsulating".
3. It is a subset of data hiding. We use getters setters etc.
4. How the car is built using various components different functions, tech, dynamics --> Encapsulation


## In-Built Packages in Java

1. lang --> Automatically imported. (Object Class)
2. io --> input/output.
3. util --> utility classes(Data Structures & Collection Framework)
4. applet --> applets in java. Servelets
5. awt --> GUI
6. net --> networking and stuffs.
